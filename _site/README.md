#Here are some fact-ish things about me:

- :koala: Koala's are cool, but Tay Swift's my real spirit animal.
- The Doctor is my favorite alien :bowtie:
- I am an avid gamer and want to work with game apis to create awesome apps for the gaming community. <br>
- I am very creative and want to express that in a pragmatic way, which is through coding! <br>
- I was a Polish folkloric dancer for the majority of my life. [I'm in green!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4En95ycalNo)

I will continue working on my Github account so you can see all the improvements i've made over the past few months!

###More info coming soon..
