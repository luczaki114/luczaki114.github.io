<p><a href="http://104.236.16.103:5000/#/">The actual site</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/HashTrack/hash_track">Github repo!</a></p>

<p>Hash Track is a dynamic new solution for digital marketers that are looking to track hash tags that they are using to promote their products and services.</p>

<h2 id="capstone-project">Capstone Project</h2>
<p>We had the option to work alone or with a partner, to create an app that could be anything. We could implement any technology that we learned or learn something completely new. I chose to partner up because I wanted to make a bigger project, and also to keep getting experience with pair programming.</p>

<h2 id="pair-programming">Pair programming</h2>
<p>Pair programming experience has been very beneficial to me. There were many times that both Matt and I had different ideas on how to get the same problem taken care of and it let me see his thought process and learn a few things as well. He spent a lot of time in callback hell so he had a better understanding of which function is calling what and when. He lead me through the code and I eventually wrote my own callbacks.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time early learning about the MEAN stack trying to wrap my head around the big picture. After having started working on the app we actually decided to change up our initial organization of angular code to better match each individual route.</p>

<p>The back and forth aspect of it, and having another person pick up where you left off is a satisfying feeling.</p>

<p>We even had our differences learning to work with others is a key skill. Knowing how to articulate my own argument and knowing that I do not know the best way to do things all the time are extremely helpful in getting the project done. In the end it made me a more humble programmer, more interested in learning, and it made Matt and I closer as people too!</p>

<h2 id="complete-mean-stack">Complete MEAN Stack</h2>
<p>The last 3 weeks we delved into MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, and Angular.js. Having had exposure to server-side MVC frameworks with Rails and Sinatra, picking up the basics of Express was not too difficult. I also used backbone on my 3rd project so I had a general idea about client-side MV* frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="the-app">The App</h2>
<p>The app was a merge between two ideas, tracking hashtags and finding out if they are unique so that a marketer can get a little insight about a marketing campaign, and seeing geolocated tweets generate on a map.</p>

<h3 id="we-started-with-user-stories-and-wireframes">We started with User stories and Wireframes</h3>
<p>We wanted to make sure that the app would function well for both casual users who just want to see a hashtag plotted on a map and marketers who would actually track the hashtag and try to get insights into their campaign. Knowing this we decided to let people use the search functionality without needing to login, but if you wanted to track that hashtag, that did require login. as for wire framing we wanted to make sure the site looked minimalist and without clutter.</p>

<h3 id="back-end">Back-End</h3>
<p>The backend consists of a database of users and hashtags that can be tracked. It also consists of our twitter API calls that are required to grab tweets of a given hashtag and login authentication.</p>

<h3 id="front-end">Front-End</h3>
<p>The front end is an SPA that does a lot of data manipulation once the backend returns a twitter JSON. It allowed us to keep everything on one page and gives us all the control that a backend framework would give us.</p>

<h3 id="some-problems">Some Problems</h3>
<p>While working with Angular we were using marker directives that made plotting all the markers a very slow process. After delving into the problem we realized that the marker directive was deprecated and we needed to use the markers directive. It required use to refactor some code.</p>

<p>The twitter API is complicated to access because they have several layers of authentication to get through. We created a separate controller to take care of returning us a JSON.</p>
