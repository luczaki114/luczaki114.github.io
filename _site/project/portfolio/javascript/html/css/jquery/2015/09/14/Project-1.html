    <p><img src="/images/ContactForm.png" alt="Contact Form Site" /></p>

<h1 id="this-is-my-about-me-website">This is my about me website.</h1>

<p><a href="http://luczaki114.github.io/project1/">The actual site</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/luczaki114/Project-1-Simple-Contact-Form">Github repo!</a></p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-project-that-was-required-end-of-week-three-for-general-assemblys-web-development-immersive-course">This is a project that was required end of week three for General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course.</h3>

<p>I needed to meet the following requirements.
* Be hosted on Github pages.
* Contain an organization structure for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Utilize vanilla Javascript OR jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Adequately represent your project scope; ie: a product website should contain product information.
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use one media query/breakpoints for Responsive Design
* Use ONE $.ajax call to external APIs and render data from them</p>

<p>Extras that could be included were:
* Include a Contact Form that works in real-time!
* Include a Google Map on you website to show the location of the service(s) provided
* Include multiple pages that follow the same design/layout as others
* Use Sass in your project for CSS variables, nesting, and more!\
* Use jQuery Animations or CSS Key Frames to make your page come to life!</p>

<p>We had 5 days.</p>

<h2 id="i-made-this-using-html-5-css3-sass-skeletoncss-javascript-and-jquery">I made this using HTML 5, CSS3, sass, skeleton.css, javascript and jQuery.</h2>
<p>This is my first site built from scratch and it taught me the importance of proper structure, and allowed me to see why some practices are considered best practices.</p>

<p>I’m not afraid of floating things or changing the position property.</p>

<p>It also let me see that I definitely not a web designer. Please give me a style guide!!</p>

<h3 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h3>
<p>The site is meant to be viewed on either a 320px-wide screen or anything over 960px.</p>

<h3 id="skeletoncss">Skeleton.css</h3>
<p>This helped me layout my site. After using it, I realized that I would want to take a better look at initial design structure so that I wouldn’t need to use negative margins in my code.</p>

<h3 id="sass">Sass</h3>
<p>Variables… and a style guide. Powerful tools to keep your code dry and easy to work with. I want to continue using sass, because it does make CSS fun. I want to create my own variables and functions that I will find useful.</p>

<h2 id="version-20">Version 2.0</h2>
<p>If given more time I would add more breakpoints to modify the grid and containers I made. I am not afraid of responsive design knowing I can use both a fluid and pixel grid.</p>

<p>I would also use a better boilerplate that I would work on first. Now that I used this and fell into some ditches I know which ones to avoid; until the next set of issues comes my way.</p>

<p>I would also add more Ajax calls, most likely from the Steam API. I would like to display my last game of Dota 2 played including some stats. I would then use jQuery to append it to the site along with predefined classes for automatic styling from my CSS.</p>

<p>I would modularize my scss files even more.<br />
I would begin the project mobile first and add breakpoints as I move out. <br />
I would begin by getting all my assets organized and in place before starting. A defined scope is liberating! <br />
I would use jQuery animations to animate my site.
I would put each breakpoint in a different scss file.<br /></p>

<h2 id="after-bootcamp-thoughts">After Bootcamp Thoughts</h2>
<p>Yep. I am not a design major.
Fixed a couple bugs with the Ajax call not working at all.
Also linked it to a super simple email server so I am getting my own emails.
I will pick up a book on some advanced css, layout and design so that my front end pages actually look decent.
I’m not talking about clientside MVC frameworks, but just plain old CSS to make my page pop.</p>
