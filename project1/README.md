came to a problem regarding keeping an image square while moving the browser around. It changed based on the width of the site. I placed another div inside it and set height to 0 and border bottom to 100%, which computes based on width of parent, not height of parent.

How to build a website timeline:

Get your stylesheet in order.

your color scheme, your fonts, your heading sizes.
Get all of the images you will use.

Know as a general rule how much content you will be placing on your site. Consider how many paragraphs, essays, titles, bylines, etc you have so you know exactly what you need to code out for.

Build your website and start by building your box model and making it responsive in at least two breakpoints.
After the boxes are set, then begin messing with styling the inside content of your boxes.

then add content and debug again.
