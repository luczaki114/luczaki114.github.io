#Chicago Ad Solution
<http://www.chicagoadsolution.com/>

This was a redesign of an old website. The client wanted to be able to add new clients as posts to a website without having to dig through a bunch of code. I used a Wordpress site and added PageLines, a tool that made drag and drop components for Wordpress sites.
This project gave me some experience dealing with clients as well as monetary constraints. At this point, I did not know much about programming languages outside of basic HTML and CSS, but there are enough resources online for me to figure out what I needed to do. I handed this site over to the client and he has been managing it ever since.

#Trading University: Live Trading Room
<http://tradinguniversityltr.com/>

This was a website build from scratch. I needed to talk with the client regarding his content strategy and expected deliverables from him to add to the site. We spoke about SEO and website layout and I offered him a few choices for templates for a Wordpress site. I communicated with him on several occasions afterwards to make sure everything looked the way he wanted it to look. Afterwards I handed this project over to him as well.
